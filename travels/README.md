# travels
A visualization of places I've been in my life.
I wanted to make a digital version of one of large maps where you put actual pins to show where you've been.
[Basemap](http://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/robin.html) makes that pretty easy.

[travelmap.py](https://github.com/wilsonify/travels/blob/master/travelmap.py) creates this plot based on coordinates in [OhThePlacesIveBeen.csv](https://github.com/wilsonify/travels/blob/master/OhThePlacesIveBeen.csv)
