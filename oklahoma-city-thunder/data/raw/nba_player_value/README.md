# NBAPlayerValue

This project first works to classify player types as seen in github.com/acheng1230/NBA_Player_Types with some modifications to increase accuracy, sample size, and modify created graphics. 2 Data scrapers were created, one for NCAA stats and the other for NBA. It then goes on to do the same for college players. Line-up and game data will later be scraped. Optimal line-ups will be determined in addition to line up strengths and weaknesses, and estimated values of players will be calculated dependent on the rosters of the team theyâ€™re leaving and going towards. An attempt to model career trajectory due to age will be made and then an attempt to model a players career including age and input trades will be calculated.

A model will be made on what types of roles college players will take in the NBA using the college data as well. Predictions as to the development of this year's draft class will be included. Various graphics will be made in attempt to make this a publishable piece at some time.

Efforts are currently focused on career stats and roles but things change yearly, so a look into applying these models to players in real time will be done in an attempt most accurately model a players value.

If anyone wants to get involved on this project and help with some of the modeling feel free to shoot me a message or make a comment. This project is my entry to the world of data science and machine learning so it's going to be slow moving while I get a better understanding of how and when to use the models in the varying capacities that I'm trying to use them in. Specifically, parsing through game data to determine line-up strengths and weaknesses is going to be the bottleneck for me as far as I can tell, so if you have ideas or recommendations, please let me know.
